I really loved this place from it\u2019s ambiance to food and service, everything\u2019s top notch.\n\nIt was Wednesday night and we were near Gachibowli and really hungry, when I suggested we will visit Jonathan's Kitchen, it is my favorite place to hangout. I was with my five friends and we started our dinner with their special starters Grilled Pomfret, Chili chicken , Crispy Corn , Chicken Wings, Nawabi shikampuri kebab, Dragon prawns and Tiger prawns. All of the starters were the best, I have never tried such before anywhere. Now that the starting was the best, I promise at the end it will be a blast.\n\nGrilled pomfret was tasty and soft to bite, it was properly cooked with perfect spices and we ordered this twice. It was so good! Chili chicken wasn\u2019t much spicy, it was well equitable of spices and the best starter to start our dinner. Crispy corn I have tried at many restaurants and I loved Flechazo\u2019s before, but now I can say the best crispy corn is at Jonathan's kitchen. I think this is the best compliment. Chicken wings for this just one word magnificent!\n\nThen my favorite part were the prawns. Here we tried 3 different types of prawns, Butter Garlic prawns; this is just out of the world first time we have tried this really the taste is unforgettable, Dragon prawns; one of my friends suggested me to try this here, Mr. Tarak, the name itself represents dragon prawns. It is the best in prawns compared to tiger prawns, Tiger prawns; these were too large in size, I have never seen the size of prawns like tiger prawns taste also too good it was the best to end our starters.\n\nThen we ordered some mocktails because it\u2019s mandatory; Orange delight ,Cucumber n mint, Virgin pina colada ,Black current, Spicy tango and Blue lagoon or blue heaven. Every mocktail has their own specialty. Orange delight and cucumber n mint were the winners of the evening. Black current is really good in taste and refreshing. Spicy tango and blue lagoon were the ultimate mocktails. Every mocktail is best at Jonathan's kitchen.\n\nThen it\u2019s time for main course, in that we ordered Dal Tadka and Rara Gosht with Butter naan and Amritsari Kulcha, and Burnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy. Every dish just left us speechless! Dal tadka and rara gosht tasted absolutely great with butter naan and Amritsari Kulcha. Burnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy was the ultimate dishe to end our phenomenal dinner at Jonathan's kitchen.\n\nBut without dessert, I never end my dinner. So here we ordered Gulab jamun, Chocolate fondant cake with vanilla ice cream and Cream brulee with Fresh fruits. All the desserts are just marvelous to end our dinner.\n\nThanks to Mr. Rashid for the lovely dinner at Jonathan's kitchen. Thanks to the entire team of Jonathan's kitchen who served us in a very good way and special thanks to Surrender and Chef vijay.\n\nMust Try:\nDragon prawns\nButter Garlic Prawns\nTiger Prawns\nGrilled pomfret\nCrispy corn\nOrange delight\nCucumber n mint\nRara Gosht\nBurnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy\nChocolate foundant with vanilla ice cream\nCreme Brulee"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"rating\": 5, \"Sentiment\": \"Gastronomic Genius\"}\n"}]}

Very warm ambience, good people and great food. Don't miss this place."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"rating\": 5, \"Sentiment\": \"Gastronomic Genius\"}\n"}]}

Were little concerened if made the right choice...but VOILA.. on the event day we were very very happy to see the below specific observations:\n1.Quality of Food - We have given few instructions on the buffet spread and also asked for North Indian taste in food. The instructions that we have given was executed line by line...not an inch of difference... Food was great...I got lot of enquires from guests that how did I locate this place... Very Very satisfied... Must taste from my side- Bengal fish curry and Nizami Handi..\n\nThe starters typically was in taking terms among the guests... Awsome..\n\n2. Service- The staff was courtious and they took care of each guests personally.. It was no less than a private party, though we havn't booked the restaurant fully...but seeing the service we  were very happy... \n\n3. Ambience- The restaurant is cleanly decorated..not so much noise in decor... As we want a special moment and we were in doubt how to setup the environment with some personal touch, the staff themselves took the lead and asked for few items in the morning...and when we entered in the evenning we were quite surprised to see the decoration just the right.. this is called the owning of stuff... \n\nKudos to the staff and management for taking our request and customizing every bit of the arrangements as per the need of the event...

There aren't many sports bar around and Arena Eleven is the swankiest ones in town. Located in the SNL terminal , this is the best destination if you are a sports fan.\n\nAMBIENCE (4/5): The seating space is quite big with multiple screens with sports channels playing on every wall and corner. They have a nice wooden furniture which also adds to the asthetics of the place. Beautifully designed restro, Arena Eleven has all glass walls and is perfect to have a city view while munching on your food. They have some good tracks playing which I liked as well.They have indoor as well as outdoor seating.Outdoor seating us just opposite to landscape of trees and was bliss to enjoy it as the rain drops poured down the city.\n\nFOOD AND BEVERAGES ( 4/5) :\n\nYou can opt for either ala carte or buffet.The place has both options.\n\nMocktails and cocktails : In mocktails we had non alcoholic sangria which was the best drink amonst all we tried. This had grape juice , with fresh apple and bartenders mix. Then we tried Mint Julep which was fresh otange wedges with mint,lime and orange juice. It was decent.Zen Zero was the one we tried next which had lemon chunks ,brown sugar ,ginger and fresh mint topped with cola. It was nothing special and was too sweet.Virgin mojito was as it should be.\n\nIn cocktails we tried Old Fashioned which had bourbon with sugar and bitters. This one was a little too concentrated and strong for me.next we had Kentucky apple cinnamon which had burbon whiskey infused with apple juice and Cinnamon. It was a delightfull drink.Then was the cucumber cooler which had gin infused with cucumber and sour mix. This drink did not appeal to my taste as was too much of cucumber taste.\n\nFood:\n\n1. Veg manchaow soup : The soup did not appeal my pallate . It was moreovee tasting like rasam than a Chinese soup.\n\n2. Tandoor items : we had some tandoori chicken legs and some chicken tikkas which were really well prepared and chicken quality was also good.\n\n3. Tandoori non veg sizzler : This was a surprise which sizzling mixed tendoori items like chicken tikka , fish tikka .it was absolutely delighfull.\n\n4.Tandoori veg sizzler : This had paneer tikka,veg seekh kabab.the veg seekh kabab was dry and lacked in flavour.\n\n5. Hot wings : The hot wings were sweet to taste where as ,as the name itself suggests it should be hot and spicy. This was a disappointing one\n\n6.Tandoori chicken tandri : Tandoori chicken tandri was tender and juicy and masalas were nicely amalgamated with the chicken peices.\n\n7. Masala Fries : This is a very new concept which I tried for the first time. The masala fries were served with chopped onions.It was really good and we couldn't stop at one or two.\n\n8.Chilli fish : chilli fish was a nicely tossed fish in oriental style.\n\n8. Chicken Tikka Pizza : chicken tikka pizza was absolutely scrumptious toppings. This was a thin crust pizza with indianised way of toppings and pizza sauce. The crust though was too hard and felt as if not freshly baked.\n\n9. Chicken seekh kabab : I absolutely loved the seekh kababs which had a nice flavours of soices coming through.\n\n10. Veg seekh kabab : the veg seekh kqbabs felt dry and lacked flavours.could be better.\n\n11. Chicken green curry and steamed rice : the chicken green curry was absolutely divine to eyes. The consistency was also creamy. The taste though was slightly to the sweeter side which dint give the balanced flavour.\n\n12. Chicken tikka biryani ( from the buffet) : absolutely yummy this biryani was the one eveeyone has there eyes on from the veey beginning. The hot steaming biryani was spicy and the lipsmacking tikkas along gave a nice taste overall.\n\nDESSERTS\n\n1. Gajar ka halwa : I absolutely loved the gajar ka halwa. Warm halwa just melted in the mouth and with the icecream along ,it felt divine.\n\n2. Kheer : the kheer was also nice and gave a cery homely taste.\n\nThe place is really nominal with good food. With this rate charged and the sports add on it provides,this place is absolutely recommended."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"rating\": 4, \"Sentiment\": \"Delightful Dining\"}\n"}]}
